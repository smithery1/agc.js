/**
 * The pass 1 symbol table gathers symbols but, for the most part, does not attempt to resolve them until pass 1 is
 * complete.
 * Each symbol appears in a location field for either an EQUALS card or some other card.
 * The value of a symbol for an EQUALS card is the operand field of the EQUALS statement.
 * The value of a symbol for another card is the address of the instruction or memory constant location used by the
 * card.
 *
 * This symbol table does not try, except when requested, to resolve the symbol values for the EQUALS symbols.
 * It simple stores the address field for later evaluation.
 *
 * The table can be asked to resolve two particular types of cards, SETLOC and ERASE.
 *
 * The SETLOC card often uses a symbolic address field but per Ref YUL, 13-163 the "symbol must be defined by an earlier
 * card in the deck."
 * So it is safe to evaluate SETLOC symbols during pass 1 and error if they cannot be resolved.
 *
 * The other card is ERASE, which when containing a signed numeric address field advances the location pointer
 * (Ref YUL, 13-168).
 * It is therefore necessary to obtain this value during pass 1.
 * Technically the ERASE card can refer to absolute addresses via an unsigned numeric or symbol address field.
 * We really should resolve only the signed numeric address for ERASE, but the current code we've tested so far does not
 * use absolute addresses so we've punted on that for now.
